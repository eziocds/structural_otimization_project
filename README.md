This repository contains a general analytical solution to determine the reaction forces of a continuous beam of length L, 
with n equidistant supports, subjected to a transversal uniform load w. A software was then developed to find the minimum
number of supports necessary to attend design constraints such as maximum force at supports, maximum bending moment given
the length L of a beam and a transversal uniform load w.

The document mathematical_model_en.docx provides the mathematical model used to derive the solution of the problem.
The directory Vigas_Continuas_Nap contains the executable file vigas_continuas_nap.exe to run the program.
